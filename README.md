### üöÄ About Me

I'm a tech enthusiast who loves diving into the world of web development. With a strong foundation in **Ruby on Rails, Python, ReactJS, Docker, and GIT**, I am always eager to expand my skill set and take on new challenges. I believe in continuous learning and sharing knowledge with the community.

I regularly write blogs on Medium and my personal website, where I explore in-depth topics like the power of **Ruby on Rails in generative AI**, the latest **Rails 7.2 updates**, **CORS in Rails**, **SEO implementation**, and more. These blogs not only help me delve deeper into these subjects but also allow me to contribute to the developer community.
